In Basilicata, for example, four periods of accumulation can be identified. Only the first one was climatically/eustatically caused, whereas the other three — dating from the Greek-Roman Epoch, the medieval times, and the last two centuries — owe their origin to man's activities (deforestation, farming etc.). The ecologically vulnerable environment (Mediterranean subtropics, easily erodable marls and clays, steep relief) was the main reason why man's influence on nature has had catastrophic effects (badland formation in the hinterland and on the valley slopes, enormous accumulations in the valleys and coastal plains).","1986","2021-10-26 13:43:56","2022-12-15 17:35:57","","7-17","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: bruckner_ManImpactEvolution_1986","","","","Verlandung; 11 Geographie und Geophysik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Das Zentrum seiner Topographie bildet ein Gipfelplateau als Standort der sukzessiv erfolgten Tempelbauten, von denen nur die Existenz eines kleinen Baus aus dem frühen 6. Jh. v. Chr. und eines großen spätarchaischen Tempels gesichert ist. Weitere topographische Fixpunkte sind die Westterrasse, deren Anfänge in einem aufgefüllten Steinbruch liegen und die mit den Funden aus dieser Auffüllung einen großen Teil der Votivgaben des Heiligtums geliefert hat, außerdem der Ostabhang mit einem Bothros, der in der Zeit um 630 v. Chr. geschlossen wurde und der mit dieser Datierung eine chronologische Neuorientierung im 7. Jh. v. Chr. notwendig macht. Gegraben wurde außerdem an einer Straße nördlich des Kalabaktepe, die nach der geophysikalischen Prospektion zum Straßenraster des spätarchaischen Stadtplans von Milet gehört hat. Die Grabung hat gezeigt, dass hier infolge des Niedergangs der Stadt nach der Perserzerstörung das neue urbanistische Konzept nicht vollständig umgesetzt wurde.","2019","2021-10-26 13:44:03","2022-12-20 10:37:21","","118-227","","1","2019","","AA","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: vongraeve_ArbeitenMiletJahren_2019","","","","Römisch; Wohnbebauung; Heiligtum; Archaisch; Hafen; Aphroditeheiligtum; Nekropole; Straßen; Stadtplan; Straßenraster; Faustinathermen; Perserkriege; Tor; Hafentor; Restaurierung; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 01 Grabungs und Arbeitsberichte; 07 Architektur; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 15 Ruinen und Geländepflege, Restaurierung; 02-04 Topographie: archaische Zeit; 07-01 Architektur: Varia; 14 Forschungsgeschichte; 08-06 Kulte: Aphrodite von Oikous; 08-07 Kulte: Artemis Kithone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since 2012, architectural members from a Hellenistic temple have been systematically documented. Analysis of them has already revealed that they belonged to a building that repeated the ornament system of the Apollo naiskos on a slightly larger scale but was nevertheless not identical to it. Adjoining the probably ancient foundations of the present-day mosque, a Hellenistic strip foundation for a further cult building at the sanctuary was exposed in 2013. Further excavations are necessary for an exact determination of the cult building. During excavations south of the Temple of Apollo in 2010 and 2011, the ruins of a theatre with a Greek plan were exposed. It was dated to the Imperial period on the basis of the archaeological record. The theatre is not mentioned explicitly in written sources, but it is now possible to localize the venue for the artistic contests that written sources say were held at the sanctuary. In 2013, south-east of the ancient site, the remains of a Christian chapel built upon ancient foundations were excavated. This initiated a reappraisal of the remaining churches from the Byzantine and early modern era.","2015","2021-10-26 13:49:34","2022-12-20 13:40:29","","109-172","","","2015","","AA","","","","","","","","German","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: bumke_Didyma20102013_2015","","","","Didyma; 01 Grabungs und Arbeitsberichte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To establish the changing character of the area and transformations of its relation to the city centre, a systematic urban survey was conducted in its territory under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ch. Berns. The survey, undertaken during 2014 and 2015, brought to light a number of finds, above all pottery and architectural ceramics. The density and spatial distribution of various materials enabled us to follow the spatio-temporal development of the Humeitepe.

"USZSU2C8","journalArticle","1986","Parke, Herbert William","The temple of Apollo at Didyma: the building and its function.","The Journal of Hellenic Studies","","","","","The Hellenistic temple of Apollo at Didyma presents several unique features in its plan. In its exterior it resembles the typical large Ionic temple of Asia Minor with a double colonnade surrounding it, no opisthodomus, and a pronaos containing three rows of four columns each. But at this point the plan of the temple was modified in the strangest manner. For the pronaos does not lead by a great central doorway into the cella, but where the doorway should come, the worshipper entering the building found himself faced with a blank wall 1·495 rn high with above it a colossal opening 5·63 m wide (PLATE VIIa). Consequently the worshipper in the pronaos could not even look directly into the sanctuary. Instead, just above his eye-level beyond the embrasure of this ‘window’ stretched the floor of a large room, 14·04 m by 6·73 m with its roof supported on two columns. Through this room's central door (which was opposite the window) the spectator on ground level outside could catch a glimpse of the upper part of the naiskos in the inner court (the adyton).","1986","2021-10-26 13:50:40","2022-12-20 10:03:46","","121–131","","","106","","JHS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: parke_TempleApolloDidyma_1986","","","","10 politische Geschichte; 10-04 Geschichte: hellenistische Zeit; 13 Umlandforschung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the Mycenaean burial rites and tombs have been introduced, the grave, called DT2012, which has come to light in the Necropolis of Miletus, is determined. Subsequently, the ceramic finds, which represent the largest part of the grave goods of DT2012, are compared with the ceramic finds from the with similar examples in continental greece and finally evaluated.

I should like in particular to direct the attention of English archaeologists to Western Asia Minor as a field of research that is practically untouched, especially as regards remains of the Hellenistic period. Brilliant results await the scientific explorer of important sites such as Sardis, Tralies, Laodicea, and Apamea, and all these are extremely easy of access. The English traveller cannot help feeling ashamed of English archaeology when he sees the unintelligible mass of ruins and brushwood that covers the site of the Artemisium at Ephesus.","1903","2021-11-30 14:35:59","2022-12-20 10:03:52","","335-355","","","23","","JHS","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: wace_RecentExcavationsAsia_1903","","","","01 Grabungs und Arbeitsberichte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"9F7UQ9W8","book","2004","Cormack, Sarah H.","The Space of Death in Roman Asia Minor","","","","","","This work examines a large group of monuments erected during the Roman Imperial period in Asia Minor. These monuments are tomb buildings, which are found throughout the ancient regions of Caria, Lycia, Pamphylia, Pisidia and Cilicia. After reviewing the Anatolian burial tradition in the archaic and classical periods (chapter 1), the tombs are analysed from a number of perspectives. First, the surrounding environment of the tomb space is discussed (chapter 2), including the frequent siting of the structure within the built urban environment (e.g. the Library of Celsus at Ephesos, intramural tombs at Ariassos in Pisidia and Arycanda in Lycia). Chapters 3, 4 and 5 focus on the architectural structure and decoration of the tombs themselves, including the manner in which the deceased was represented within the tomb space, serving as a visible reminder of his or her social status while living. Evidence for ritual activity by the living at the tomb site - a necessary element of the perpetuation of memory - is also analysed (chapter 6). The analysis presented in chapter 7 of these funerary inscriptions indicates that they not only reinforced the social and familial status of those who erected them, but also attempted to protect the tomb from violation via the threat of fines, divine retribution, or both. The conclusions which emerge from this reconstruction of the overall environment of the tomb space indicate that these structures not only contributed to the urban landscape via their imposing presence and sacred resonances, but they also functioned as permanent reminders of the civic benefactions carried out by their patrons, in this sense conferring honour on the city and perpetuating the memory, familial associations, and social status of the dead. A Catalogue of known tombs and an Appendix conclude the work.","2004","2021-12-01 17:18:26","2022-12-15 17:34:36","2020-12-03","","","","","","","","Wiener Forschungen zur Archäologie","6","","","Phoibos","Wien","","","","","","","","Citation Key: cormack_SpaceDeathRoman_2004","","","","Grab; Nekropole; Urbanistik; Heroa; Heroon; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 09 Gräber und Bestattungen; 08-09 Kulte: Heroa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is argued that while the Greek poleis were highly vulnerable to ecologically and socially induced stress and catastrophe, they were at the same time remarkably resilient in a way that their individual inhabitants could not be. It is argued that this social resilience was a product of relations with other communities which served as a kind of buffer against risk; it is thus the communal response to stress and catastrophe that enables social resilience. A variety of relations between communities contributed to social resilience, including kinship, sympoliteia, and isopoliteia, but it is argued that the koinon was the most effective social structure in achieving this end, by institutionalizing economic and political relations between communities that allowed for diversification and redistribution of both populations and resources. In writing the history of abandonment in the Classical and Hellenistic poleis, evidence is drawn from literary and epigraphic sources as well as intensive and extensive survey, excavation and studies of landscape change in antiquity.","2004","2021-12-01 17:18:26","2022-12-15 17:34:35","","493-516","","4","108","","AJA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation Key: mackil_WanderingCitiesAlternatives_2004","","","","Myus; Mäander; Verlandung; Malaria; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 10 politische Geschichte; 02-05 Topographie: klassische Zeit; 10-03 Geschichte: klassische Zeit; 02-06 Topographie: hellenistische Zeit; 10-04 Geschichte: hellenistische Zeit; 13 Umlandforschung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They amounted to six or seven distinct pieces of land on the Asiatic mainland (apart from the adjacent islands, which again seem to have presented differences of status). A triple division of the Milesian territory on the mainland is already made by Herodotus. In the first place, in i. 18 he records that the Milesians suffered defeats at the hands of Sadyattes ἔν τε Λιμενηίῳ χώρης τῆς σφετέρης καὶ ἐν Μαιάνδρου πεδίῳ It might at first sight appear that the Maeander plain here referred to was not Milesian territory. But Strabo (xiv. 647) seems to indicate that Magnesia, which lay far up the plain, suffered Milesian occupation after its destruction by the Treres in the seventh century; and there are various testimonies to Milesian possession of the lower Maeander plain in later times. Again, in vi. 20, Herodotus tells us that after the fall of Miletus (               c               . 494 B.C.) the captive citizens were removed by the Persians:                                             The distinction between the part round the city and that in the plain evidently corresponds to that already observed in i. 18; and it is matched by the distinction drawn in an inscription of Miletus (of the first half of the second century B.C.) between the ‘Milesia’ proper and the Μιλησίων χώρα lying across the Latmic Gulf. Herodotus' triple division is thus clear: the ‘home territory’ around Miletus itself, the Milesian land in the plain, and third the mountain land, which is evidently Grion.","1961-11","2021-12-13 10:58:51","2022-12-15 17:36:45","2021-12-13 10:58:51","90-101","","","56","","BSA","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: cook_SitesMilesianTerritory_1961","","","","13 Umlandforschung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing from classical archaeology, the theory and history of urbanization, geology, and hydraulic engineering, Crouch examines water-system elements, including springs, fountains, wells, channels and drains, latrines, laundry, and dishwashing, as they relate to each other and to the physical, historical, and social bases of ancient Greek cities.  Studying numerous sites including Pompeii, Pergamon, Athens, Samos, Delphi, and Corinth, she concludes that increased knowledge and skill in management of water contributed directly to the urbanization of the ancient Greek world.  Illustrated with excellent photographs and line drawings, the discussions of supply, distribution, and drainage of water are organized topically, rather than chronologically or by site, offering an excellent example of the interdisciplinary approach. Crouch's study raises stimulating questions for further research, indicates entirely new directions for established academic disciplines, and suggests useful procedures for modern cities facing problems of water supply and management.","1993","2021-12-21 13:18:07","2023-01-27 10:46:53","2021-12-21 13:18:07","","","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: crouch_WaterManagementAncient_1993","","","","Wasser; Wasserversorgung; 07 Architektur; 07-10 Architektur: Wasserversorgung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7HUL793X","book","1999","Nawotka, Krzysztof","Boule and Demos in Miletus and Its Pontic Colonies from Classical Age Until Third Century A.D.","","978-83-04-04493-7","","","","This work covers the period between the early fifth century BC and the mid-third century AD, although the author occasionally goes beyond these dates. This chronological framework reflect the nature of evidence, none of which precedes the second quarter of the fifth century BC. Profound changes in the whole Roman Empire after Severus Alexander (in the period of the Crisis of the Empire) caused epigraphical sources to disappear almost completely. The Empire which emerged from this Crisis under Diocletian was a state of a different character than that of the Principate. The bulk of this work is based on documents created by the councils and assemblies of Miletus and its Pontic colonies or in connection with their legislative activity. Evidence is almost exclusively epigraphic. This, of course, brings to mind some of the most hotly debated issues of Greek epigraphy, such as the function of inscriptions in a largely illiterate society, or the relation   between legal acts once produced by the boule and demos and inscriptions in stone. Both are difficult to approach because of the paucity of evidence resulting largely from dissimilar interests and needs of people in antiquity and modern scholars. The first of these questions has not been resolved even in the case of Athens whose history, especially in classical age, is illuminated far better by very diverse sources than any other city or state in antiquity.","1999","2021-12-30 13:55:58","2022-12-15 17:35:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","Zakład Narodowy im.

Famous ancient harbour cities like Ephesos, Miletos, Kaunas and also Troy are now several kilometres inland. High sediment loads of the rivers - often anthropogenetically induced - led to the silting up of the former sea ports; thus the cities lost one of their major functions. The phases of coastal progradation are deciphered by the interpretation of historical sources and geological evidence. A study of sediments and fauna indicates the milieu of deposition (marine, lagoonal, swampy, terrestrial) while radiocarbon dated material and artifacts provide the chronostratigraphical framework. Geoarchaeological research aims to reconstruct the former landscape and trace the phases of sedimentation in historic and prehistoric times. This paper presents information on the evolution of the deltas of Büyük Menderes (Miletos ), Küçük Menderes (Ephesos), Dalyan (Kaunas) and Karamenderes (Troy).","1997","2021-10-26 13:43:56","2022-12-15 17:35:15","","63-74","","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: bruckner_CoastalChangesWestern_1997","","","","Mäander; Verlandung; 11 Geographie und Geophysik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes the situation in Milet and presents the results of crust analysis by microscopic, chemical and petrophysical techniques. Based on the results yielded we believe that exogenous carbonate crusts are formed due to microbiological activity. This is influenced by periodic flooding of parts of the site. Hypersaline conditions and varying water levels have created a special environment which supports complex microorganism growth. Initial results of biological analysis point to the fact that cyanobacteria are mainly involved into the process of cyclic crust growth. Even though crusts have been detected mainly on surfaces there is a need to remove these disturbing and sometimes endangering layers. Tests with different cleaning techniques - laser, mechanical and chemical procedures - have been performed. Mechanical treatment has proved to be a suitable technique for cleaning as well as for the preservation of the original marble surface.","1999","2022-01-06 10:35:11","2022-12-15 17:35:05","","731-736","","","","","","","","","","","","London","English","","","","","","","Citation Key: bruggerhoff_CarbonateCrustsMarble_1999","","","","15 Ruinen und Geländepflege, Restaurierung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Untersuchung zum Krustenaufbau und Entwicklung von Konzepten zu ihrer Abnahme","","","","","","Die Marmorobjekte in der Ausgrabungsstätte von Milet weisen an ihrer Oberfläche stark verfremdende Krusten auf. Als Ursache für die Krustenbildung wird die zyklische Überflutung weiter Teile des Grabungsgeländes angesehen. In dieser Diplomarbeit wird die Mitwirkung von Mikroorganismen am Entstehungsprozess dieser Krusten untersucht. Neben der Charakterisierung unterschiedlicher Ausprägungsformen der Krusten wird durch verschiedene Untersuchungen ihre Zusammensetzung und ihre Auswirkung auf die Marmorsubstanz bestimmt. Anhand der auftretenden Schadensphänomene an den Marmorobjekten wird deutlich, dass die Krusten ein Schadenspotential darstellen. Die Entwicklung von geeigneten Maßnahmen zu ihrer Abnahme bildet einen weiteren Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit.","1999","2022-01-06 10:28:50","2022-12-15 17:35:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","FH Köln - Institut für Konservierungs- und Restaurierungswissenschaften","Köln","Deutsch","","Diplomarbeit","","","","","Citation Key: cheba_BiogenInduzierteKalkkrusten_1999","","","","15 Ruinen und Geländepflege, Restaurierung; 13 Umlandforschung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7HBGYDZF","thesis","2005","Raymond, Amy","Miletus in the Middle Bronze Age and Minoan presence in the eastern Aegean","","","","","","This dissertation is the analysis of the MBA Period III level at Miletus, and it establishes certain fundamentals concerning the site: (1) the site was inhabited during the early MBA period, (2) the material culture reflects southwestern Anatolian traditions and therefore the inhabitants should be considered indigenous, (3) the settlement was located directly on the coast in an ideal harbor area, (4) this location afforded access to a north-south and east-west crossroad, (5) there is no evidence of hiatus, however this is the earliest period when Cretan influence is discernable in local pottery production and the first Minoan (MM IB--MM IIB) imports appear, and (6) although the quantity of these imports is high in comparison with MM IB--MM IIB imports elsewhere east of Crete, they account for less than 2% of the ceramic assemblage. These numbers are reversed in Period IV, when Minoan or Minoanizing pottery account for over 95% of the excavated material. The first chapter of this dissertation reviews the century-old excavation at Miletus as it pertains to its prehistoric settlements and provides a primer on the history and present state of excavation and research of MBA culture in southwestern Anatolia. The second, third and fourth chapters present the MBA level at Miletus, its general stratigraphy, architectural features, ceramics and small finds. Chapter 3 concerns the local ceramics, and the imported protopalatial ceramics are catalogued in Chapter 4. I examine the Milesian material within its larger geographic context in Chapter 5, isolating the Anatolian and Aegean parallels. Chapter 6 contains a discussion of the Middle Minoan influence in the eastern Aegean and its consequent impact on the nature of the Miletus settlement. Less than a decade ago, there was no indication that the Milesian peninsula had been settled in the Early or the Middle Bronze Ages. Because the prehistoric deposits previously excavated were Late Chalcolithic and Late Bronze Age in date, a hiatus of occupation was assumed. In 1997, our understanding of the site changed dramatically when a new excavation campaign uncovered a MBA Anatolian habitation level that was replete with imported Middle Minoan goods","2005","2022-01-06 16:40:12","2022-12-19 11:47:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Toronto","Toronto","en","","Dissertation","","","","","Citation Key: raymond_MiletusBronzeAge_2005","","","","02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 02-02 Topographie: Bronzezeit; 10 politische Geschichte; 10-01 Geschichte: Bronzezeit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"9KDMYI2Q","book","2004","Voigtländer, Walter","Teichiussa. Näherung und Wirklichkeit","","","","","","Die Architektur im bronzezeitlichen Altteichiussa und im frühantiken Teichiussa mit seinem Umland an der karischen Küste Kleinasiens wird zwischen 1984 und 1989 entdeckt und erforscht, die Bausubstanz vermessen und steingerecht gezeichnet. Die ungewöhnlichen Bauwerke lassen sich keiner bekannten Kultur Kleinasiens oder der Ägäis genau zuordnen. Entsprechend aufwendig wird der Kontext zu den Monumenten aus vorantiker Zeit mit Hinweisen zu bronzezeitlichen Megara, altkretischer und altlydischer Architektur sowie aus frühantiker Zeit mit Nachweisen thaleischer und ggf. pythagoreischer Geometrie in den Entwurfsplänen zu beispielhaften Bauten ermittelt. Die Anfänge führen in die Kupferzeit zurück; Altteichiussas Blütezeit liegt in den Phasen MM III / SM Ia, mithin in der Zeit altkretischer Expansion; die Blütezeit zu Teichiussa und seinem Umland gehört in die archaische Zeitspanne. Genau beschriebene Architektur und katalogisierte Kleinfunde werden auf ihren kulturgeschichtlichen Kontext hinterfragt und ein Zusammenhang zwischen archaischen Monumenten im Umland Teichiussas und bronzezeitlichen Vorgaben aufgedeckt. Das Werk verweist immer wieder auf Menschen als Auftraggeber und Nutzer der entdeckten Monumente aus prähistorischer wie frühgeschichtlicher Zeit auf dem Nordufer des Golfes von Mandalya, den Thukydides [VIII, 26.28] als Golf von Iasos beschreibt, und schließt mit einem Kapitel über die Branchiden, Verwalter des zu Teichiussa nahen Branchidai-Didyma. Die Monographie erschöpft sich nicht in einer Beschreibung entdeckter Funde und ihres Kontextes, sondern bezieht auch Stellung zu Methoden des Faches und versucht neue Wege zur Altertumsforschung anzudeuten.","2004","2022-01-06 15:33:34","2022-12-15 17:34:33","","","393","","","","","","","","","","VML Vlg Marie Leidorf","Rahden/Westfalen","Englisch","","","","","","","Citation Key: voigtlander_TeichiussaNaherungUnd_2004","","","","13 Umlandforschung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The relationship between the city and the land, and the role that it played as a bridge between east and west, are examined through a series of case studies."" ""The socio-economic themes developed in the book include the search for metals, the city's extensive links throughout the Mediterranean, its population and the foundation of a series of colonies across the Black Sea. Miletos' chief cult centre, the oracle of Apollo at Didyma, and its relationship to the city are examined in detail and the role that Miletos played as a centre for philosophy and learning is briefly explored. Its early Minoan and Mycenaean origins are also investigated.""--Jacket.","2002","2021-10-26 13:50:09","2022-12-15 17:34:43","","","192","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","London","English","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: greaves_MiletosHistory_2002","","","","Geschichte; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 10 politische Geschichte","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ihre Datierung fällt in die 1. Hälfte des 6. Jhs.v.Chr., ihre Größe führt auf einen kleineren Bau, der in seinen Dimensionen etwa dem älteren Tempel im Heiligtum der Athena entsprochen haben wird. Aus der Tatsache, daß auch der frühe Bau im Aphroditeheiligtum durch einen spätarchaischen Tempel abgelöst wird, kann zusätzlich auf eine parallele Bauentwicklung in den beiden milesischen Heiligtümern geschlossen werden. Außerdem wird die vermutete Abfolge von zwei Kultbauten im Aphroditeheiligtum durch den Gesamtbefund der bisherigen Ausgrabungen auf dem Zeytintepe gestützt, der zwei große Phasen der Umgestaltung des gesamten Bereiches erkennen lässt. Wenn die dargelegten Schlussfolgerungen richtig sind, wären im übrigen auch die frühesten Giebelskulpturen in der ostionischen Architektur nachgewiesen.","2005","2021-10-26 13:50:40","2022-12-15 17:34:26","","41-48","","2","2005","","AA","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: vongraeve_FundeAusMilet_2005","","","","Heiligtum; Archaisch; Zeytintepe; Tempel; Bauforschung; Aphrodite; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 03 Funde aus Milet; 08-06 Kulte: Aphrodite von Oikous; 03-04 Funde: Skulptur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Miletus, situated near the village of Balat in the present district of Soke was founded on a peninsula, approximately 2.5 km long. In the Byzantine period, the city boundaries were quite reduced. In 1424 Miletus was taken inside of the Ottoman Empire and was completely abandoned in the 17th century. Ancient Miletus excavation studies were first begun in 1899 by in Berlin Museum and interrupted during the World War I. At present, the extensive restoration works in Ilyas Bey Complex has applied as a project since 2006. Ilyas Bey Complex that includes Mosque, Medresah and baths situated on the archaeological area in ancient Miletus. Impressive Mosque built in 1404 by Ilyas Bey, Emir of Menteseogullari founded in 1279 and the complex was named after him, is one of the most remarkable buildings of mid-age Miletus. There are two main purposes of the study are (1) to determine archaeological remains of the study area underneath Ilyas Bey Complex and (2) to define the nature of main rock unit and their sources in the vicinity or Aegean region. After preliminary archaeometrical studies, acquired GPR profile data paralleled each other in Ilyas Bey Mosque and its around, Medresah Courtyard and inner Courtyard of the Mosque. After processing 2D parallel GPR profiles, we constructed 3D data volume by lining processed 2D profiles up to correlate remain signatures from each profile for each studied area. It was obtained transparent 3D visualisation of GPR data by assigning a new colour scale for the amplitude range and by constructing a new opacity function instead of the linear opacity function. Therefore we could successfully image the archaeological remains in an interactive transparent 3D volume and its sub-volumes, starting at different depth levels or limited profiles. The archaeometrical (geological and mineralogical, petrographical) studies reveal that the main building rock units of Ilyas Bey Mosque are mainly composed of 4 main units these are marble, metalimestone, mica gneiss and granodiorite. The marble, metalimestone with the mica gneiss were obtained from Menderes Massif in Western Anatolia. The granodiorite columns might be obtained from Kozak Pluton in the north of Bergama-Izmir line of western Anatolia.","2008","2022-01-27 09:49:07","2022-12-19 15:54:03","","1-8","","","","","","","IOP Conference Series.

Wie in den vergangenen Jahren umfassten die Arbeitsbereiche in Milet sowohl Grabungen als auch Denkmälerrestaurierung und Ruinenpflege sowie naturwissenschaftliche Untersuchungen. Den Schwerpunkt bildeten die Grabungen im archaischen Heiligtum der Aphrodite auf dem heutigen Zeytintepe: Über sie wird ein eigener Vorbericht in diesem Band vorgelegt; außerdem sind einige kleinere Materialpublikationen aus den Grabungen hervorgegangen, die im nächsten Halbband der Zeitschrift veröffentlicht werden. Ausführlicher wird in der Einleitung auf die Ergebnisse der geophysikalischen Prospektion im Rahmen der interdisziplinären Programme der Miletgrabung eingegangen und versucht, sie in das Gesamtbild der Forschungen über die Stadt einzuordnen. Darüber hinaus werden die Arbeiten zur touristischen Erschließung des Ruinengeländes, über die kein eigener Bericht vorliegt, kurz zusammengefasst.

Moreover ceramics for the Emirates period present novelty in form and design which excites us with new forms and designs we haven’t seen up today.","2010","2021-12-01 17:18:27","2022-12-15 17:34:07","","289-304","","","","","","","","","","","Ege Yayınları","Istanbul","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: gok-gurhan_BalatIlyasBey_2010","","","","Keramik; Mittelalter; Balat; Moschee; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-05 Funde: Keramik; 03-05-09 Keramik: Mittelalter","","Pektaş, Kadir; Cirtil, Saim; Cirtil, Selda Özgün; Öztaşkın, Gökçen Kurtuluş; Özdemir, Hicran; Uykur, Ramazan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PLFJGKKB","thesis","2013","Sümer, Ökmen","Pliyo kuvaterner Söke Milet havzasının oluşumu / Evolution of the plio quaternary Soke Milet basin","","","","","","Plio-Quaternary Söke-Milet Basin is a transtensional asymmetric basin, trending NE-SW and filled with Late Pliocene-Pleistocene Fevzipaşa Formation and recent alluvial, marine fan-delta and Büyük Menderes marine river delta deposits. The basin was opened on the transtensional supradetachment Miocene Soke Basin that formed under the control of the Oyukdağ detachment fault and Prine-Sazlı Fault activeted as a dextral transfer zone. The Miocene Söke basin consists of Söke Formation resting on crystalline basement rocks unconformably, Davutlar Conglomerate unconformably with Söke, Kuşadası Formation conformably with Davutlar and Hisartepe volcanic rock intrusions. After late Late Miocene-Early Pliocene compressional and strike-slip deformation period, transtensional Pliyo-Quaternary Söke-Milet Basin was began to extend. The Fevzipaşa Formation overlying the Miocene rock units is composed of two sedimentary sequences of the terrestrial at lower part and shallow marine fan-delta facies associations (FA) at upper part, intervaled with an allostratigraphic unconformity. These are; lower alluvial fan deposits (FA 1), fresh water carbonate lake deposits (FA 2), fan-prodelta deposits (FA 3), shallow marine fan-delta slope deposits (FA 4), nearshore sandy mouth-bar deposits (FA 5) and upper alluvial fan deposits (FA 6). Due to the sedimentary facies analysis, the Söke discrict effected from abrupt marine transgression or ingression in the early Early Pleistocene. The shallow marine fan-deltaic deposits related with this marine were deposited in front of Yamaçköy fault between 2.40 and 0.95 Ma in the relatively tectonic quiescience period. The sand deposition on shore coming from hyperconcentrated flow-generated alluvial fans, sand progradation, reworking and redeposition by currents and waves and decreasing subsidence of the hanging-wall block of the Yamaçköy Fault was controlled the deposition of the shallow marine fan-deltaic deposits.ixDuring the late Late Pliocene-Holocene extension period, due to increasing of the tectonic activity, the recent sediments were deposited control on the reactivated Priene-Sazlı and other ancient faults and, the last basin morphology was formed obliquely to the Büyük Menderes Graben. The northern basin margin is active, while the southern margin inactive or less active in present day.Keywords: Western Anatolia, Söke-Milet Basin, Büyük Menderes delta, shallow marine fan-delta, transtensional basin","2013","2022-01-28 13:40:00","2022-12-15 17:33:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi Izmir","Izmir","","","Dissertation","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: sumer_PliyoKuvaternerSoke_2013","","","","Mäander; Geologie; Pleistozän; 11 Geographie und Geophysik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maßgeblich für diese Vorstellung ist in erster Linie von Gerkans Identifikation mehrerer ausgedehnter Baukomplexe als Marktanlagen, die ihrer topographischen Lage nach gemeinhin als Nord-, Süd- und Westmarkt bezeichnet werden. Mit dem vorliegenden Beitrag wird dieses Modell erstmals kritisch hinterfragt. Anhand architekturtypologischer Kriterien wird aufgezeigt, dass sich sowohl die räumliche Verteilung von merkantilen Anlagen innerhalb der Stadt Milet als auch deren chronologische Einordnung anders darstellen, als bislang angenommen. Abschließend wird eine neue Bewertung der Rolle vorgenommen, die die merkantilen Bauten in der städtebaulichen Entwicklung Milets spielten.","2013","2021-12-01 17:18:27","2022-12-15 17:33:52","","51-74","","","63","","IstMitt","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: emme_MarchenDreiMarkten_2013","","","","Heiligtum; Kaiserzeit; Hellenistisch; Markt; Nordmarkt; Antiochos I; Staatsmarkt; 07 Architektur; 07-05 Architektur: Platzanlagen und angrenzende Bauten; 07-07 Architektur: Gymnasia und Thermenanlagen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Offenbar von derselben Reliefplatte stammend, zählen solche Tonerzeugnisse innerhalb der Gruppe der Architekturterrakotten zur Gattung der Verkleidungsplatten, die mit diesem Sujet vor allem aus Larisa am Hermos bekannt geworden sind. Sie werden in das 3. Viertel des 6. Jhs. v. Chr. datiert und – ohne dass deren Herstellungszentrum bisher zweifelsfrei nachgewiesen werden konnte – mit den Lydern in Verbindung gebracht. Aus diesem Grund sollten sie besser als Verkleidungsplatten ›lydischen Typs‹ bezeichnet werden. Da es sich um einen Einzelfund handelt und kein Hinweis auf einen architektonischen Zusammenhang am Fundort besteht, wird vorgeschlagen, in dem Stück ein hinsichtlich seiner Verwendung singuläres Weihgeschenk an Aphrodite zu sehen, auch wenn die Frage unbeantwortet bleiben muss, wer der Stifter gewesen sein kann.","2014","2021-10-26 13:52:32","2022-12-15 17:33:43","","169-178","","1","2014","","AA","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: zimmermann_FundeAusMilet_2014","","","","Archaisch; Architektur; Terrakotten; Zeytintepe; Architekturterrakotten; Lydien; Weihgeschenk; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 03 Funde aus Milet; 08-06 Kulte: Aphrodite von Oikous; 03-06 Funde: Terrakotta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Milet – Koruma, Turizm ve Çevre Koşulları","Heritage in context : Konservierung und Site Management im natürlichen, urbanen und sozialen Raum. Doğal, kentsel ve sosyal çerçevede koruma ve alan yönetimi","","","","","Die Ausgrabungen in Milet haben eine lange Tradition, die bis ins 19. Jahrhundert zurückreicht. Von Anfang an haben die Ausgrabungen in Milet dazu beigetragen, grundlegende wissenschaftliche und methodische Fragen in der Archäologie aufzuwerfen; in Bezug auf Fragen der Erhaltung des kulturellen Erbes steht Milet auch heute noch vor großen Herausforderungen. Neben der großen Ausdehnung der Ausgrabungsstätte selbst stellen regelmäßige Überschwemmungen eine große Bedrohung für den Schutz der Ruinen und die touristische Erschließung der Stätte dar. Um weitere Schäden zu verhindern, hat das Deutsche Archäologische Institut im Herbst 2012 eine Kampagne gestartet. In einem ersten Schritt wurden Symptome, Ursachen und Auswirkungen der Überschwemmungen analysiert. Auch wenn die Ergebnisse noch keine endgültigen Antworten liefern können, ermöglichen sie eine systematische Analyse, die bei der Entwicklung von Präventionsmaßnahmen für archäologische Stätten mit ähnlichen Problemen hilfreich sein kann. Milet wird jedes Jahr im Spätherbst überflutet, wobei einige Ruinen bis zum Sommer des folgenden Jahres überschwemmt sind. In diesen Monaten ist das Zentrum der Stätte nicht zugänglich, und kleinere Gebäudeteile sind nicht sichtbar. Ein weiteres Problem stellen Mikroorganismen dar, die sich in stehendem Wasser bei steigenden Temperaturen ansiedeln und auf Marmor und anderen Steinen feste Krusten bilden, die diese Oberflächen dauerhaft überziehen. Neben diesen potenziellen Schadensfaktoren werden in diesem Beitrag verschiedene andere negative Auswirkungen der Überschwemmungen erörtert. Insbesondere werden Lösungen vorschlagen, die sich aus den veränderten Rahmenbedingungen vor Ort ergeben.","2014","2021-10-26 13:43:56","2022-12-15 17:33:44","","253-268","","","","","","","Miras","2","","","Ege Yayınları","Istanbul","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: taschner_MiletKonservierungTourismus_2014","","","","Überschwemmung; 11 Geographie und Geophysik; 15 Ruinen und Geländepflege, Restaurierung","","Bachmann, Martin; Maner, Çiğdem; Tezer, Seçil; Göçmen, Duygu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die Fundkontexte erlauben auch eine Korrektur und Verfeinerung der Datierung der beiden wichtigsten Dekorationsweisen milesischer Gefäßmaler archaischer Zeit, des Tierfries- und des sog.

As for Late Geometric it is clear that a number of shape variations cohered to a conservative tradition, and that seems to apply to the hinterland as well. It is not until Late Geometric that production increases, a development that can be observed in Karia as well.

It underwent two main building phases, both of which appear to be linked to building phases of the theatre, one Hellenistic and the other Roman. The cave contained terracotta figures and limbs that might have been votive offerings. 44 late antique oil lamps may also have been votives; they were buried inside the spring when the spring was filled in at the turn of the fifth century A.D. or soon thereafter. The infill also contained marble heads from the stage building of the theatre that had previously been mutilated, probably by Christians and possibly in order to mar their beauty. The infill hid the spring as well as burying the lamps and marbles. This appears to have had the twofold function of closing the sanctuary – probably in response to the anti-pagan laws of the Theodosian emperors – and of protecting the sacred spring, the votive offerings, as well as the marble heads from further abuse and destruction. In addition, findings from around the cave also shed light on the history of the seaward defences that may date back to Archaic times and, in the Byzantine period, were renovated to include a sophisticated gate with zwinger.","2016","2021-10-26 13:49:34","2023-01-26 12:11:41","2022-02-09 12:20:29","67-156","","1","2016","","AA","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Citation Key: niewohner_AncientCaveSanctuary_2016","","","","Römisch; Heiligtum; Terrakotten; Hellenistisch; Theater; Straßenraster; Höhle; 01 Grabungs und Arbeitsberichte; 07 Architektur; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 07-03 Architektur: Theater; 08-01 Kulte: Varia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper provides such data and fills in some crucial gaps in our knowledge of the urban development and in our understanding of the rural hinterland. The city appears to have lost much of its former population by the 6th century A.D., which was a particularly prosperous time for the surrounding villages. Thereafter, agriculture continued relatively undisturbed throughout the Persian and Arab invasions, the middle Byzantine period – with considerable prosperity at rural sites – and the Turkish conquest. The city, in contrast, was deserted during the middle Byzantine period. Middle Byzantine prosperity turns out to have been a rural phenomenon of the agricultural hinterland, and urbanism was dead long before the arrival of the Turks, who had to rebuild Miletus under the new name of Balat.","2016","2021-12-01 17:18:27","2023-01-26 12:12:01","2022-02-09 12:14:19","225-290","","2","2016","","AA","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Citation Key: niewohner_ByzantineSettlementHistory_2016","","","","Byzantinisch; Keramik; Spätantik; Chora; Menteşe; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 11 Geographie und Geophysik; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-05 Funde: Keramik; 03-03 Funde: Bauteile, Bauornamentik; 13 Umlandforschung; 05 Archäozoologie, Archäobotanik, Anthropologie; 03-09 Funde: Münzen; 02-08 Topographie: Spät und Nachantike; 03-05-08 Keramik: Spät und Nachantike","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identify Cretan and other imports to Miletus, characterise the main local fabrics at the site, and then show some recently discovered evidence for Milesian imports at Knossos, Akrotiri and Ayia Irini. These Milesian imports are quite diverse, ranging from conical cups, to jugs and amphoras, to loomweights. They appear to indicate a richly-textured set of connections across the Aegean, rather than a network geared solely towards the circulation of metals and exchange of commodities. We argue that the emergence of this particular network configuration in the Neopalatial period is significant, as it coincides with the rising importance of Knossos and the diversification of links across the Aegean.","2015","2022-02-09 10:45:06","2022-12-15 17:33:40","","199-210","","","","","","","Universitätsforschungen zur prähistorischen Archäologie","270","","","Habelt Verlag","Bonn","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: knappett_MilesianImportsExchange_2015","","","","Handel; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 02-02 Topographie: Bronzezeit; 06 Importe aus Milet andernorts; 06-02 Importe aus Milet: Keramik","","Panagiotopoulos, Diamantis; Kaiser, Ivonne; Kouka, Ourania","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The baths were built at the turn of the second century A.D. (phase I). The main access seems to have been from the west through a vestibule, where coin finds probably attest to the payment of an entrance fee. The bather would then have followed a tour of at least four rooms, starting and ending in a changing room and including warm, hot and cold bathing rooms. Smaller additional rooms may have been used for various medicinal purposes. A first, late antique renovation took place in the later fourth century and appears to have been concerned primarily with strengthening the support system of the vaulting (phase II). A second, early Byzantine renovation around 500 A.D. included a new, higher floor level that responded to annual flooding due to the progressive siltation of the Maeander River (phase III). The Byzantine renovation also led to a new layout, whereby two warm bathing rooms were now closed off from each other and had separate entrances; this resulted in a double bath, probably for the simultaneous but separate bathing of men and women.","2015","2022-01-28 10:47:06","2022-12-15 17:33:39","","173-235","","1","2015","","AA","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: niewohner_SudstadtthermenMiletVom_2015","","","","Römisch; Keramik; Thermen; Spätantik; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 01 Grabungs und Arbeitsberichte; 11 Geographie und Geophysik; 07 Architektur; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-05 Funde: Keramik; 03-02 Funde: Varia; 02-07 Topographie: Kaiserzeit; 02-08 Topographie: Spät und Nachantike; 03-05-08 Keramik: Spät und Nachantike; 07-07 Architektur: Gymnasia und Thermenanlagen","","","","","Göçmen, Duygu; Klein, Christina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jh. von Theodor Wiegand entdeckt und in den 1970er Jahren von Wolfgang Müller-Wiener ausgegraben, aber bislang nicht publiziert. Dies wird hiermit nachgeholt, nachdem 2013 weitere Ausgrabungen und eine Neuuntersuchung des Komplexes vorgenommen werden konnten. Der Bischofspalast wurde in der 1. Hälfte des 5. Jhs. n. Chr. an der Stelle eines spätrömischen Peristylhauses aus dem 3. Jh. n. Chr. errichtet, das im 4. Jh. n. Chr. umgebaut worden war. Über dem zerstörten Palast war noch eine Töpferei aus der Zeit des türkischen Emirats von Menteşe (14./15. Jh.) zu verzeichnen sowie noch später und höher osmanische Bebauung. Der Bischofspalast war eng mit der ihm südlich benachbarten Michaelskirche verbunden, die offenbar als bischöfliches Oratorium und Palastkapelle diente. Die Kapelle, ein Vestibül in Form eines langgestreckten Apsidensaals, ein verhältnismäßig großer Hauptsaal sowie der Verzicht auf einen zentralen Peristylhof unterscheiden den Bischofspalast einerseits von spätantiken Peristylhäusern, verbinden ihn andererseits mit dem sog. Byzantinischen Palast von Ephesos und gehen wohl auf die geänderten Repräsentationsbedürfnisse frühbyzantinischer Amtsträger zurück.","2015","2021-12-01 17:18:27","2022-12-20 10:36:37","","181-273","","2","2015","","AA","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: niewohner_BischofspalastMiletSpatromisches_2015","","","","Römisch; Wohnbebauung; Byzantinisch; Bischofspalast; Mosaik; Spätantik; Menteşe; Peristylhaus; 01 Grabungs und Arbeitsberichte; 07 Architektur; 07-01 Architektur: Varia; 07-09 Architektur: Wohngebäude","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously he has had only thirteen or fourteen vases attributed to his hand, but with the discovery of Laconian pottery at Miletus by this Painter, many other known vases, including some especially distinguished ones, can be attributed to him either directly or with strong probability, including the name vases of the Grammichele Painter and the Painter of Lakaina 1016. This changes our knowledge of his work significantly, placing him among the major Laconian painters, and an important influence in the development of the Laconian style ca. 595 – 575 B.C. His work is found often in export markets, especially Italy-Sicily and the eastern Aegean, and from this it is clear that he helped to establish a solid customer base for Laconian pottery overseas.","2015","2022-02-09 09:45:12","2022-12-15 17:33:38","","1-73","","","130","","JdI","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: schaus_PainterTarantoFish_2015","","","","Schwarzfigurig; Keramik - Gefäßmalerei; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-05 Funde: Keramik; 03-05-04 Keramik: archaische Zeit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its geographical position marks the marine bounder between the Dodecanese and the neighboring western Anatolian coastline, specifically the estuary of the Meandrus river and the area of ancient Miletus. The current archaeological researches in the fort at the site called “Kastraki” reveal the siginificant fortified harbour of ancient Tragaia which flourished especially during the Hellenistic period (3rd–1st cent. BC.). From the study of the vast number of small finds we are able to reconstitute aspects of the residents’ daily activities (fishing, beekeeping, weaving and pottery production), their religious beliefs and practices. Their  productive activities indicate a thriving economy, trade and political contacts with the Ionic metropolis, Miletus, and the other  Aegean islands, but also with major cities of Asia Minor during the Hellenistic and Roman periods.","2015","2022-02-09 09:10:47","2022-12-15 17:33:37","","95-104","","","","","","","British Archaeological Reports.

A recurrent phenomenon addressed by this article is the unexpected, yet clearly purposeful, lack of design amid built-up architectural spaces, providing a new clue, as I will suggest, to the understanding of the aesthetics of monumental architecture. This leads to a more general discussion of Hellenistic and Imperial urban landscapes, in particular the (changing) relationship between monumental architecture and urban infrastructure, and the pehnomenon of empty spaces within towns. The fundamental claim of this article served as contrast for enhancing the impression of lavish urban architecture, and therefore fulfilled, an essential function in framing the latter.","2016","2021-10-26 13:52:24","2022-12-15 17:33:35","","303-328","","2","62/2","","RA","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: dietrich_ExposedBedrockMiletus_2016","","","","Römisch; Kaiserzeit; Agora; Heilige Straße; Hellenistisch; Priene; Spätantik; Urbanistik; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 07 Architektur; Fels; 02-05 Topographie: klassische Zeit; 02-06 Topographie: hellenistische Zeit; 07-05 Architektur: Platzanlagen und angrenzende Bauten; 02-07 Topographie: Kaiserzeit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The location and the history of these sanctuaries has been investigated based upon a model that places the city at the centre of the territory. According to this model, the location of these sanctuaries has been classified under the categories: urban, semi-urban and extra-urban. However, an alternative approach to this model can be through recognizing that the history of these sanctuaries was shaped by their interaction with both the physical and human geography. Applying this alternative model, one could go on to examine the impact of the “human geography” on the choice of the particular location and the spatial organization of these sanctuaries. Thus, in Ionia since the sea provides the principal communication surface between different fragments of the region, access to the sea is a common feature of many Ionian sanctuaries and it seems between the Bronze Age and the Archaic Period there was a repeated similarity in the religious responses to the topography of the environment.","2016","2022-02-11 08:10:44","2022-12-15 17:33:34","2022-02-11 08:10:44","11-29","","4","2016","","CEDRUS","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: eren_TopographyReligionArchaic_2016","","","","Heiligtum; Archaisch; Topographie; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 08-06 Kulte: Aphrodite von Oikous; 08-01 Kulte: Varia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the political and economic situa-tion of Miletus is also considered during the period when the altar of Cape Monodendri was built. According to this evaluation, the following results can be asserted: 1. The cape where the altar was built was an orientation point for the sailors in ancient times and, in fact, is still today. In addition, the altar probably served as a “lighthouse” as well. 2. There is no similar typological example of a Poseidon altar as the one at Cape Monodendri. In this context it appears that no standard planning has ever been applied to altars in ancient times. 3. The altar at Cape Monodendri was built for the cult of Poseidon Enipeus, probably during the third quarter of the 6th century BC, a time when Miletus was known as “the pearl of Ionia”. At this time, it was very likely intended as a monument of propaganda by the Milesian tyrant Histiaios.","2017","2022-02-11 09:09:39","2022-12-20 09:43:01","","183-210","","","25","","Olba","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: mert_KapMonodendriPoseidon_2017","","","","Archaisch; Altar; Poseidon; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 08-01 Kulte: Varia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nach den jüngeren Grabungen lässt sich auch Milet mit einer stattlichen Fundmenge diesen Orten anschließen. In dem Band werden die neuen milesischen Funde wissenschaftlich vorgelegt und ihre Stellung innerhalb des südostägäischen Gesamtkomplexes zyprischer Koroplastik diskutiert. Dabei steht erneut dessen stilchronologische und produktionstechnische Einordnung im Vordergrund. Aufbauend auf den regionalstilistischen Studien Sabine Fourriers auf Zypern werden die engeren werkstattspezifischen Verbindungen der südostägäischen Funde untersucht und es wird nach deren Herkunft auf Zypern gefragt. Hierbei gelingen u. a. ergänzende Einblicke in die verschiedenen Herstellungsprozesse der Terrakotten sowie der Nachweis von unterschiedlichen Serien an hohl und massiv mit Matrizen hergestellten Figuren. In Einzelfällen scheinen sogar individuelle Modellierungen konkreter Koroplasten oder eng zusammenarbeitender Handwerkergruppen erkennbar, die es erlauben, ein umfangreicheres Œuvre über verschiedene Figurenformate und Produktionsweisen hinweg nachzuzeichnen. Damit verengt sich das Bild für den Großteil des südostägäischen Fundmaterials, für das schon früh eine auffällige stilistische Homogenität erkannt wurde, auf sehr wenige in einem engeren zeitlichen wie räumlichen Rahmen arbeitende Werkstätten aus dem unmittelbaren topographischen Umfeld von Salamis auf Zypern. Die Ergebnisse erweitern und schärfen die bisherigen stilistischen und produktionstechnischen Untersuchungen, können diese aber auch in Einzelfällen korrigieren. Auf Grundlage der neuen Grabungsergebnisse in Milet und der Überprüfung der samischen Kontexte zyprischer Koroplastik wird eine neue Datierung für den Import der Terrakotten in die Südostägäis vorgeschlagen, der konträr zu den bisherigen Ansätzen innerhalb weniger Jahrzehnte bis ca. 630 v. Chr. stattgefunden hat. Daneben leiten die neuen Funde an wahrscheinlich in Milet hergestellten zyprisierenden Terrakotten zur Diskussion von technischen Anregungen auf das südostägäische Koroplastenhandwerk über, die die heimischen Handwerker durch Autopsie der umfangreichen zyprischen Importe erhalten haben könnten. Schließlich werden die Terrakotten als Zeugnisse der regen zwischenkulturellen Austauschprozesse im früheisenzeitlichen Mittelmeerraum hervorgehoben und nach der Identität der Stiftenden gefragt. Dabei könnten spezifische Verteilungsmuster der Figuren darauf hindeuten, dass sie nach konkreten technischen wie inhaltlichen Aspekten von der Lokalbevölkerung ausgewählt wurden.","2017","2021-10-26 13:41:56","2022-12-15 17:33:27","","","","","","","","","Milesische Forschungen","7","","","Deutsches Archäologisches Institut","Berlin","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: henke_ZyprischenTerrakottenAus_2017","","","","Archaisch; Aphroditeheiligtum; Terrakotten; Zeytintepe; Zypern; Werkstatt; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 03 Funde aus Milet; 08-06 Kulte: Aphrodite von Oikous; 03-06 Funde: Terrakotta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eine Prosopographie","","","","","","Die archäologische und historische Erforschung der ionischen Metropole Milet und des zugehörigen Heiligtums in Didyma begann im letzten Jahrzehnt des 19. Jhs. Die Ausgrabungen erbrachten seither mit außerordentlich vielen fast vollständigen und noch zahlreicheren fragmentarischen Inschriften aus allen Teilepochen ein unschätzbares Quellenmaterial zur Ergänzung der literarischen Überlieferung, wie es in diesem Umfang in der antiken griechischen Staatenwelt nur noch aus Athen bekannt ist. Die neue Prosopographie erfasst listenartig erstens die aus Milet und seinem Gebiet epigraphisch bzw. literarisch bezeugten Individuen, die dort Bürger waren, zweitens die außerhalb dieser Orte bezeugten Milesier (z. B. Richter, Militärs) und drittens solche Nichtmilesier, die mit dieser Stadt maßgeblich zu tun hatten (wie z. B. Herrscher, Statthalter, Gesandte). Der so erfasste Zeitraum reicht vom 6. Jh. v. bis zum 6. Jh. n. Chr., deckt also nahezu die gesamte Antike ab. Die Personen werden mit allen sie betreffenden Belegen sowie der zugehörigen relevanten Forschungsliteratur kurz in ihrem Aktionsprofil (z. B. Amtsträger, Grabherr, Agon-Sieger, Philosoph) vorgestellt; ggf. wird auf ihre gesicherten oder vermuteten Verwandten verwiesen. Durch die Familienangehörigen in chronologisch vertikalen oder zeitgleichen Dimensionen lassen sich zum einen Netzwerke der Funktionseliten konkret fassen, zum anderen Kontinuitäten und Brüche historischer Entwicklungen der Stadt samt ihrem Umland zuverlässiger als bisher nachvollziehen.

"LR78Y5VN","journalArticle","2017","von Graeve, Volkmar","Beobachtungen zur Herstellungstechnik milesischer Terrakotten im 7. Jahrhundert v. Chr. Ein Beitrag zur orientalisierenden Phase der frühgriechischen Kunst","Archäologischer Anzeiger","","","10.34780/6714-NE4M","","Der Artikel beleuchtet einen kleinen Ausschnitt aus dem größeren Problemkreis der orientalisierenden Phase der frühen griechischen Kunst. Die Notwendigkeit, sich mit diesem Thema zu befassen, ergibt sich durch die Tatsache, dass in dem neu entdeckten Aphroditeheiligtum in Milet zur Überraschung der Ausgräber über 1200 sogenannte dädalische Terrakotten gefunden wurden, die in der archäologischen Forschung als sichere Indikatoren für eine Übernahme von ikonographischen Typen aus den Kulturen des Vorderen Orients in die griechische Kunst des 7. Jhs. v. Chr. gelten. Der dädalische Stil wurde bisher hauptsächlich mit den dorischen Kunstzentren auf der Insel Kreta und der Peloponnes verbunden. Nun kommt eine zahlenmäßig große und ikonographisch reiche Tradition in Ionien hinzu, was mit der geographischen Lage von Milet zu tun haben kann. Bei einer Erhellung des Phänomens der Übernahme, das sehr schnell ideologisch überlagert werden kann, sollten zunächst einmal handfeste Grundlagen geschaffen werden. In unserem Fall geschieht das durch eine scheinbar banale Untersuchung der Handwerkstechnik. Da die autochthonen ionischen Terrakotten während der gesamten Zeit des 7. Jhs. v.

Dabei bewährt sich einerseits die bisherige wissenschaftliche These von einer teilweisen Umstrukturierung im stilistischen Erscheinungsbild der Vorbilder. Andererseits kommt hinzu, dass sich die alten Werkstätten radikal mit ihren Produktionsweisen durchsetzen und so zu den Grundlagen des gemeinsamen dädalischen Stils beitragen.","2017","2021-11-30 14:59:23","2022-12-20 10:37:12","","15-29","","2","2017","","AA","","","","","","","","de","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: vongraeve_BeobachtungenZurHerstellungstechnik_2017","","","","Archaisch; Terrakotten; Dädalisch; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-06 Funde: Terrakotta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diese Baumaßnahme kann anhand bautechnischer Eigenarten in den späten Hellenismus oder die frühe Kaiserzeit datiert werden, was wiederum mit der Fundkeramik, die seit hellenistischer Zeit eine intensivere Nutzung des Humeitepe erkennen lässt, korrespondiert. Bei der nordwestlich vom Tor freigelegten Baustruktur aus römischer Zeit könnte es sich um den Teil einer für den Handelshafen zu erwartenden Halle handeln. Im Nordosten des Hügels wurde schließlich der Abschnitt einer spätrömischen Befestigungsmauer, der ›Gotenmauer‹, (wieder)entdeckt. In diese Mauer war ein Relief aus dem späten 3. Jh. n.

During the Holocene, prominent environmental and coastline changes have taken place in many tectonic grabens of western Asia Minor, today's Turkey. The Büyük and the Küçük Menderes fault systems are excellent examples for deciphering these changes. Since mid-Holocene times, the eponymous rivers have advanced their deltas, silting up marine embayments which had once reached inland for tens of kilometres. To describe this terrestrial–marine–terrestrial evolution of estuarine islands we coin the term “life cycle of estuarine islands”. Besides other factors, such as natural erosion, sea-level changes, and tectonic activities, the delta progradation was mainly governed by riverine sediment load, which, in turn, was to a great extent dependent on human impact on the vegetation cover of the drainage basins. Based on historical accounts as well as modern geoarchaeological research it is possible to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of the landscape. For Miletos and the Büyük Menderes (Maiandros, Maeander) graben, remarkable transformations have been revealed: the metamorphosis of the marine gulf into residual lakes (Lake Azap, Lake Bafa), the landlocking of islands (Hybanda, Lade, Asteria, Nergiz Tepe), the transition of the Milesian archipelago to a peninsula and finally to a part of the floodplain. A dramatic effect of the ongoing accumulation of fine-grained sediments was the siltation of harbours – a major reason for the decline of the once flourishing coastal cities of Myous, Priene, Herakleia, and finally Miletos, today some 8 km inland. For Ephesos and the Küçük Menderes (Kaystros) graben, the research focused on the former island of Syrie. Pliny the Elder (Naturalis Historia, c. CE 77) attributed the landlocking of Syrie to the Kaystros River – a scenario which has been verified by our geoarchaeological research and 14C–dated to the 5th century BC. The local foundation myth according to which an island, presumably Syrie, was the location of the first settlement of immigrants from the Greek mainland in the 11th century BCE can neither be proven nor disproven for lack of archaeological evidence. The delta advance was the main reason why the settlement sites and the harbours of Ephesos were relocated several times from the Early Iron Age to the Middle Ages.","2017","2021-10-26 13:43:56","2022-12-15 17:33:29","2022-02-11 10:12:56","876-894","","","12","","JASc","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: bruckner_LifeCycleEstuarine_2017","","","","Ephesos; Mäander; Verlandung; Lade; Geoarchäologie; 11 Geographie und Geophysik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Views of the road have become ossified around an orthodox reconstruction of the route, which is assumed to have remained relatively static from the Archaic to the Roman period. A reexamination of the full epigraphic and archaeological evidence, incorporating the latest research in the region, highlights the many gaps in our knowledge and the possibility that the route and identity of the Sacred Way may have changed substantially through time. Computational modeling of the local topography confirms the feasibility of alternative routes and the effect that probable long-term landscape change around Panormos might have had.

It has become clear in more recent years, however, that Laconians were in regular contact with East Greeks generally, as well as with Lydians, in the Archaic period, for political, economic and cultural reasons. Recent Laconian pottery finds at Miletus suggest that Samos was not an exclusive destination in East Greece for significant quantities of this ware.","2018","2022-02-11 10:50:38","2022-12-15 17:33:23","","285-302","","","","","","","Colloquia Antiqua","19","","","Peeters","Leuven","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: schaus_LaconiaEastGreece_2018","","","","Archaisch; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-05 Funde: Keramik; 03-05-04 Keramik: archaische Zeit","","Gül Gürtekin Demir, Rafet; Cevizoğlu, Hüseyin; Polat, Yasemin; Polat, Gürcan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using extensive new primary data and original models for calibrating radiocarbon dates in transitional lagoon environments, we demonstrate that Lake Bafa (or Bafa Gölü, in Turkish) formed at a much earlier date than previously thought. In questioning the logical process by which previous dates were achieved, we re‐examine the relationship between sedimentological data, archaeology and written history. We reassert the need to establish independently dated environmental data sets as the foundation of regional studies as distinct from archaeological and historical interpretive processes. We conclude that Lake Bafa slowly transitioned to become an isolated lagoon sometime between the end of the second millennium B.C. and end of the first millennium B.C.; becoming a fully closed brackish lake during the second millennium A.D. This marks a major shift in our understanding of the nature of human occupation and activity here during the last four millennia but also in the way we date ancient lagoons and integrate historical and environmental data in general.","2020","2022-02-03 10:41:32","2022-12-15 17:33:18","2022-02-15 10:18:41","1-19","","5","35","","","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: akcer-on_RedatingFormationLake_2020","","","","Mäander; Geologie; Bafa Gölü; Radiokarbondatierung; Geoarchäologie; 11 Geographie und Geophysik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"WPNQMRPP","journalArticle","2020","Greaves, Alan M.; Knight, John Brendan; Rutland, Françoise","Milesian élite responses to Persia: The Ionian Revolt in context","Hermathena","","","","","This article applies concepts of agency, habitus and postcolonialism to a close textual criticism of Herodotus’ narrative in order to construct a nuanced understanding of how the Milesian élite negotiated their relationship with Persia and the resultant social context that resulted in the fateful decision to attack the Persian seat of Sardis and begin the Ionian Revolt. Herodotus portrays the earlier Milesian attempt to settle at Myrkinus as a pivotal event and, like the attack on Sardis itself, it can be can be understood to have been prompted by a Milesian habitus of gaining arête (honour) through colonisation and war, a habitus that was already long-established under the preceding rule by Lydia. This article views habitus as a generative, rather than a restrictive, force in the historical interpretive process - which is closer to Bourdieu’s original concept and provides a fresh perspective on the meeting of the Milesian élite and Persian imperial spheres. Taking a generative view, the Milesian leader Histiaios can be seen to have leveraged Persian aid to gain arête for himself by founding a city, whereas his successor, Aristagoras, channelled Persian military power into an opportunistic raid on Naxos. When that failed, and perhaps inspired by Polykrates of Samos, he attacked Sardis in an attempt to regain his arête. The ‘revolt’ he initiated, which we see as a functional behaviour within a specific social context, then itself becomes a literary construct that serves as a vehicle for Colonialist and Orientalist constructs of past events (including by Herodotus himself) which is it hard to disentangle from the originating context of the events themselves.","2020","2022-02-15 09:40:39","2022-12-15 17:33:16","","68-147","","","204-205","","","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: greaves_MilesianEliteResponses_2020","","","","Perserkriege; 10 politische Geschichte; 10-02 Geschichte: archaische Zeit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vacek). Investigation of the Byzantine city walls from the Invasion period has led to the discovery of a minor gate, probably a sally port (S. Giese). On Humeitepe, a small Turkish mosque or so-called mescit has been discovered (Ph. Niewöhner). A survey on Humeitepe confirms the ancient settlement history of this urban area through the analysis of small finds (Ch. Berns - S. Huy). New palynological findings improve our understanding of the Byzantine settlement history in the vicinity and the hinterland of the city (A. Izdebski). In addition, the paper also reports extensive site management and conservation work. The former includes new visitor paths, display panels, and guide books. The latter has resulted in a new presentation of the Bishop's Palace as well as structural consolidation of the Baths of Faustina, where they were at risk of collapse (Ph.

During the excavation in the East-West trench to the West of the Bouleuterion in 1959 a peristyle court with mosaic floor that apparently belongs to an Atrium House was discovered. Selected deposits from thestrata above and below the mosaic floor as well as from the Byzantine Cistern in the close proximity of the peristyle court provide important evidence for identifying the different phases of occupation.

In the course of a re-examination of the excavation’s findings since 2017, it has been possible to find similar rings from different places in the Mediterranean.

These are here interpreted, for the most part, as relicts of agro-economic field systems of unknown date, but most plausibly established during the Archaic, Hellenistic or late antique periods and perhaps used for centuries after, before the economic decline of the region in the second millennium AD. While earlier survey work has noted the existence of terracing and rural divisions at certain points in the landscape, the new remote-sensing data have provided an unprecedented large-scale insight into the extent and variety of forms of division, as well as documenting the stripping of macquis overgrowth by modern farming practices, which has, on the one hand, exposed these ancient landscapes but also, on the other, poses a threat to their preservation. The extent of the linear features suggests a high degree of land use on the peninsula at certain points in the past. Further investigation of these important features has the potential to provide critical insights into the economic history of rural and urban Miletos over the last 2,000 to 5,000 years.","2020","2022-02-15 08:35:04","2022-12-15 17:33:14","","181-206","","","70","","AnSt","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: wilkinson_AgroPastoralPalimpsestNew_2020","","","","Milesische Halbinsel; 13 Umlandforschung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this identification should be abandoned. Despite the apparent name difference, it can be proved that the city in question was Pidasa of Mount Grion, the eastern neighbor of Miletos. Obviously this city did not flourish as it might have. But this does not mean that it was a poor and negligible state, doomed to quickly disappear.

Dieser Artikel diskutiert die kultische Bedeutung von Felsen für den Demeter-Kult, ihre Felsenheiligtümer in Ostgriechenland und wie Felsen in die Riten von Demeter integriert worden sind.","2019","2022-02-15 07:01:50","2022-12-15 17:33:20","","145-165","","","","","","","Berlin Studies of the Ancient World","69","","","Topoi","Berlin","","","","","","","","Citation Key: karatas_RockCutSanctuariesDemeter_2019","","","","Demeter; Demeterheiligtum; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; Fels; 08-08 Kulte: Demeter","","Döhl, Rebecca; Jansen van Rensburg, Julian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This qualifies as Byzantine antiquarianism, appears to have been unrelated to paganism, and was practised by Christians. Comparison with similarly well-preserved ancient cityscapes at Aphrodisias and Ephesus suggests that Byzantine antiquarianism was inspired by the ancient monuments themselves, because they continued to distinguish old cities even after their former privileges had been abolished by Byzantine administration. Other Byzantine settlements elsewhere in Anatolia lacked ancient monuments and displayed no antiquarian tendencies. Conversely, a focus on the preservation of ancient cityscapes may also explain why western Asia Minor, despite being the most urbanised part of the region, did not develop a Byzantine architectural style of its own.","2019","2022-02-15 06:54:08","2022-12-15 17:33:19","","191-216","","","","","","","Malalas-Studien","3","","","Franz Steiner Verlag","Stuttgart","","","","","","","","Citation Key: niewohner_ByzantinePreservationAncient_2019","","","","Byzantinisch; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 07 Architektur; 15 Ruinen und Geländepflege, Restaurierung; 07-01 Architektur: Varia; 02-08 Topographie: Spät und Nachantike","","Borsch, Jonas; Gengler, Olivier; Meier, Mischa","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4IGX2VXZ","thesis","2018","Radloff, Lana","Maritime Dynamics and the Polis in Hellenistic Asia Minor (323–c. 133 BCE)","","","","","","This dissertation examines the role of the maritime environment within the polis. The polis, the quintessential Greek socio-political organization from the 8th c. BCE onward, was comprised of the asty and chora, in opposition to the eschatia (the area “wild and untamed by humans”). Included in Aristotle’s description (Politics 7.5.2-5) of the ideal polis, harbors – from their liminal position between city and sea – straddled the metaphorical and physical boundary between civilized and uncivilized places; as such, their continued control was critical to oversight of the city. Nevertheless, they facilitated trade, communication, and transportation networks, so harbors also served as important mediators within the settlement and between the settlement and larger Mediterranean culture. To evaluate the role of the maritime environment in the polis, I examine the physical and spatial relationship between harbors and urban planning from a seaward perspective. Using a theoretical and methodological framework influenced by urbanism, social space theory, and Mediterranean, maritime, and coastal studies, I take a holistic approach to the maritime environment that emphasizes the interaction of coast, islands, land, and sea. I adopt the idea that an agora in grid-planned cities functioned as a “hinge,” because it connected the various sectors of the settlement, thereby reflecting its pivotal role in the public life of the polis, and use it to conceptualize harbors as similar in form and function to agoras. Focusing on the west coast of Asia Minor, I use literary, epigraphic, and archaeological sources to reconstruct and to analyse the physical and spatial layouts of the harbor-city matrices of Miletos and Rhodes, by analysing patterns of spatial access and lines-of-sight built into the natural environment between open sea, harbor, and urban interior. Applying my theory and methodology to Miletos and Rhodes, I conclude that city-states incorporate maritime space into their territory as a mechanism of power and control. They created a “maritime chora” and integrating harbors into the asty or terrestrial chora. A maritime chora was created at Miletos and Rhodes, by populating the adjacent coast, islands, land, and sea with shrines, temples, and altars. Since the monuments incorporated myth-historical figures and events from the cities’ past, civic identity was built into the seascape, setting up a narrative for seafarers before they entered the harbor and urban centre, which increased connectivity between city and sea. In doing so, both mainland Miletos and insular Rhodes expanded their territorial control, linking the cities to regional and “international” networks of the southeast Aegean Sea. Miletos and Rhodes used architecture and urban planning to draw their harbors into their territory. Both harbor and agoras were demarcated from the larger urban plan with monumental and utilitarian architecture that emphasized their interior space and facilitated the socio-political, economic, and religious activities carried out there. In conjunction with its maritime chora, such an arrangement increased connectivity and access between the larger seascape and urban interior, drawing the maritime environment into Miletos and Rhodes’ territory and emphasizing the importance of seafaring for the city.","2018","2022-02-18 10:38:54","2022-12-15 17:33:23","","","265","","","","","","","","","","State University of New York","Ann Arbor","","","Dissertation","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: radloff_MaritimeDynamicsPolis_2018","","","","Hafen; Chora; Rhodos; Urbanistik; 02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 07 Architektur; 02-06 Topographie: hellenistische Zeit; 13 Umlandforschung; 07-08 Architektur: Häfen und maritime Infrastruktur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deissmann maintained that the inscription was clearly Christian and from the sixth century, after the conversion of the theater into a citadel. This study argues that the inscription is not distinctively Christian and probably dates from the fourth or fifth century. Recent archaeological research indicates that the conversion of the theater into a citadel occurred in the seventh, rather than in the sixth century. Thus, the palaeographical characteristics of the inscription can be explained only if the inscription originated earlier than the conversion of the theater. This earlier date suggests that the purpose of the inscription was probably not magical protection from military foes but rather protection from plague or other diseases. An analysis of a selection of magical gems demonstrates that the ovals of the inscription bear a significant resemblance to ovoid protective magical amulets from the late Roman period. The study concludes that an inscription long held to be Justinianic and Christian is most likely neither.","2011","2022-02-24 11:01:21","2022-12-20 10:05:37","2022-02-24 11:01:21","55-78","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","Citation Key: cline_ArchangelsMagicalAmulets_2011","","","","Theater; Spätantik; Christlich; Erzengel; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-08 Funde: Inschriften","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore the Market Gate will be back-build and rebuild in near future. For the reconstruction of the columns special mortars are necessary which must be compatible to the marble and steel construction. Restoration mortars with adapted colour, physico-mechanical and chemicalmineralogical properties as well as with sufficient pH-values to prevent steel corrosion were developed. Mortars with binder mixtures of pozzolanic materials and white cement combined with defined aggregates and chemical additives fulfill the mentioned requirements.

"6CIB962U","journalArticle","2007","Thompson, Daniel","At the Crossroads: Prehistoric Settlement in the Maeander Valley","Anatolian Studies","","","","","The Maeander river (modern Büyük Menderes Nehri) provides the longest natural route through the mountains of central western Anatolia to link the Aegean basin to inner Anatolia, and research suggests that permanent settlement within the river's catchment had begun at least tentatively by the Late Neolithic period. However, the limited amount of archaeological research in the region has restricted our understanding of the inhabitants' settlement histories and intra- and inter-regional cultural contacts during prehistory. This paper seeks to understand better the nature of settlement dynamics and cultural interactivity from the Neolithic period through to the Late Bronze Age in this region by reviewing the available literature within a broad geographic context encompassing western Anatolia and the Aegean, neighbours whose archaeological evaluations have largely been conducted in isolation from each other. The evidence suggests that these early communities interacted with each other and inter-regionally with fluctuating intensities during prehistory, with the interior remaining more traditionally Anatolian, while the lower, coastal area experienced increasing interaction with and influence from Aegean cultures over time. The lower valley also displays a relatively static number of prehistoric sites in contrast to the middle and upper regions, where more dynamic and largely parallel settlement histories are seen.","2007","2022-06-04 08:29:21","2022-12-15 17:34:17","","87-99","","","57","","AnSt","","","","","","","","Englisch","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: thompson_CrossroadsPrehistoricSettlement_2007","","","","02 Allgemeine Darstellungen / Topographie; 02-01 Topographie: Prähistorisch; 13 Umlandforschung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die Darstellung praktischer Maßnahmen wird dabei mit der Beschreibung und Reflexion der zunehmend international ausgerichteten Entwicklung der Theorie der Denkmalpflege verschränkt. The uncovering and exploration of historical building fabric entails a responsibility for what has been exposed. Using excavation sites of the German Archaeological Institute in Turkey such as Pergamon and Miletus, this volume shows how actors at different times attempted to fulfil this responsibility: in terms of the legibility of the ruins, but also and increasingly with regard to landscaping, economic and social as well as cultural-identity-oriented concerns. The description of practical actions is intertwined with the description and reflection of the increasingly international development of the theory of monument preservation.","2022","2022-06-04 08:52:34","2023-03-30 06:56:21","","","","","","","","","Beiträge zur Geschichte der Archäologie und der Altertumswissenschaften","4","","","Harrassowitz","Wiesbaden","","","","","","","","Citation Key: steudtner_ResteNochEindrucksvoller_2022","","","","15 Ruinen und Geländepflege, Restaurierung","","Steudtner, Katharina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PK7ZE44F","journalArticle","2021","Reich, Alexander","Untersuchung der Hafenbecken Milets unter nautischen Gesichtspunkten","Skyllis. Zeitschrift für maritime und limnische Archäologie und Kulturgeschichte","","","","","The ancient city of Miletus (Turkey) had, economically seen, an advantageous position as it was located at the exit of the Meander valley on the South Ionian coast. According to Strabo (geogr. 14,1,6) the city had four harbours. Based on the archaeological evidence and the geoarchaeological investigations in and around Miletus, four potential harbours can be identified to match Strabon’s statement: Lion Harbour, Theatre Harbour, Humeitepe Harbour, and East Harbour. The four harbours were investigated with a focus on their nautical properties for the period from the 5th century BC to the 3rd century AD. A holistic approach was chosen for the reconstruction of the harbours. The following factors were taken into account: archaeological evidence, topographical and artificial landmarks, geoarchaeological and geophysical analyses, written sources, shipwrecks, wind conditions, currents, and sea conditions. Wind and waves could hinder the approach to the harbours at certain times. These and other possible hindrances could potentially be avoided by the orientation on landmarks in and around the city. Overall, Miletus can be considered a safe port, with a large trade volume and potential.","2021","2022-06-20 14:02:25","2023-01-27 10:54:06","","91-99","","","21","","Skyllis","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: reich_UntersuchungHafenbeckenMilets_2021","","","","07 Architektur; 07-08 Architektur: Häfen und maritime Infrastruktur","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the data which have been so far revealed in the course of the excavation the existence of flat pan tiles has been documented, in three variants of their usual overlapping shape, and of double slopping cover tiles which have close to their upper edge a relief band for their better interlocking. Of particular interest is the find of flat pan tiles’ fragments which have their corners perforated; this indicates, as the preliminary comparative study has shown, that the perforations served for the better attachment of the first, or even more, set of tiles in the frame of a wooden roof iron nails. In addition the implementation of mortars or clay bedding during the placement of the tiles reveals an existing intricate roofing technique at the Milesian fort.","2015","2022-10-09 11:05:38","2023-01-26 12:12:43","","113-118","","","","","","","British Archaeological Reports.

In the course of this project the previously used Milesian documentation system was comprehensively modernized and adapted to the use of digital tools. The explanations and guidelines in this document serve as a '<em>documentation of the documentation</em>' and are intended to help staff members use the system in a consistent manner across multiple projects, as well as preserve our methods of working and organizing for future generations of archaeologists and transparently explain our research methods to the public. The manual aims to facilitate the use and to provide an overview of the data structure for long-term archiving and cooperation. The manual and all the corresponding forms are currently available in German and English. We provide several additional documents along with the digital version of this manual. While the excavation is mainly organized by three universities (University of Hamburg, Mimar Sinan Güzel Sanatlar Üniversitesi in Istanbul and Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris), we also want to thank our many cooperation partners listed in the preface without whom none of our work would be possible. Please also note: While the whole manual and documentation are a group effort, and many more people have contributed to this project with their time, ideas and corrections, people responsible for a section of the current or previous version of this manual have been listed in this repository as contributors.

In a funeral inscription from Miletus, well known since 1843, two passages have been neatly erased already in Antiquity. Recently they were carefully reconstructed by Praust and Wiedergut. This contribution aims to deepen the social and legal meaning of the text being not fully grasped by the authors. Surprisingly, among the persons entitled to be buried the owner of the grave monument did not mention his wife, and he restricted his sons to being sheer participants in the grave. On the other hand, he entrusted an outsider woman and her children (probably his own offspring) with power of disposal over the grave. Because of this woman his wife might have quitted the wedlock and claimed her dowry. After the owner’s death the dispute was settled resulting in the two erasures: the younger son, objecting the compromise, had been completely excluded and the former wife finally was admitted being buried in the monument.","2021","2022-10-25 08:02:12","2022-12-15 17:33:11","2022-10-25 08:02:12","595-606","","1","138","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Citation Key: thur_WerLiessGrabinschrift_2021","","","","03 Funde aus Milet; 03-08 Funde: Inschriften","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hestia (Ἑστία) was at the same time the goddess of the hearth - domestic hearth or hearth of public buildings - and the common name for this hearth-altar. The existence of the goddess Hestia in the Miletus pantheon can be assumed from the Archaic period onwards. In Miletus, Hestia is worshipped in the hypostasis of Βουλαῖα which confirms the association of the goddess with the sphere of civic and political life of the city. The existence of the goddess in the pantheons of the Milsian colonies can be deduced, with three exceptions (Cyzicus, Sinope and Naucratis), on the basis of the epigraphic attestation of theophoric anthroponyms derived from the goddess' name.","2021","2022-10-25 08:05:24","2022-12-15 17:33:13","","475-482","","","28.2","","","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: feraru_CultulZeiteiHestia_2021","","","","08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 08-01 Kulte: Varia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studia Archaeologica","","","","https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=1009569","Our aim herein is to discuss the cult of goddess Hekate in Miletus and the Milesian colonies founded on the coast of the Hellespontus, the Sea of Marmara and Pontus Euxinus (the Black Sea). In Miletus,Hekate was an important deity, as recorded by the large number of epicleses under which the goddess was worshiped. Hekate was revered in the sanctuary of Apollo Delphinios of Miletus as the entemenios deity of the latter. Hekate’s presence in the pantheons of the Miletus’s colonies (Abydos, Kardia, Prokonnesos, Cyzicus, Sinope, Apollonia Pontica, Anchialos, Odessos, Tomis, Olbia, Pantikapaion, Gorgippia) may be inferred, with few exceptions, from the epigraphic record of the theophoric anthroponyms deriving from the goddess’s name. At Olbia and Milet, the celebration of Triakades was held in Hekate’s honour, on the thirtieth day of each month. The rituals performed to honour Hekate on the thirtieth day of the month coincided with the honours awarded to the dead.","2021","2022-10-25 08:37:49","2022-12-15 17:33:13","","107-125","","1","35,1","","","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: feraru_CultGoddessHekate_2021","","","","08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 08-01 Kulte: Varia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through our work, the research field of human-computer interaction is represented in the Cluster for the first time. This paper introduces our interdisciplinary research on immersive applications for understanding WA. We motivate the usage of virtual reality (VR) technologies for the novel field of WA research, in which we explore new immersive ways of studying WA. Currently, only fieldwork provides the spatial context to the WA in the inscribed spaces. Immersive applications could provide researchers with virtual access to the spatial and even temporal context at any time, but so far, VR has not been used in academia for this use case. We developed two immersive VR systems with a user-centred design approach in close cooperation with academic experts from ancient history, classical archaeology, and theology, among other fields. Our VR systems visualize WA with their temporal and spatial context and provide additional content such as reconstructions, hidden layers, and meta information. Our tool was developed for two different application scenarios, (1) a large outdoor scenario of the ancient Roman theatre of Miletus, and (2) an interior scenario of the church at the Rittergut Lucklum.","2021","2022-12-05 09:51:14","2022-12-15 17:33:13","","31-35","","","","","","","","","","","The Eurographics Association","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: gabel_UserCenteredDesignImmersive_2021","","","","07 Architektur; 03 Funde aus Milet; 03-08 Funde: Inschriften; 07-03 Architektur: Theater; 16 Methodik, Vermessungsarbeiten","","Orlosky, Jason; Reiners, Dirk; Weyers, Benjamin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The argument we will put forward is that the fact that Miletus was a political city enabled the development of philosophical thought. We define political city as a city where there is a field of speech and rights, a relationship of mutual recognition between competing classes, where sovereignty is shared, and open to change. In this respect, in our study, we try to reveal the historical conditions that made Miletus a political city and make clear the balanced distribution of sovereignty and reveal how this ground has changed the understanding of the universe. Considering that the history of civilization has developed through hybridization, Miletus is a city that absorbs and transcends the accumulation of Mediterranean, Anatolian, Mesopotamian and the surrounding civilizations. The accumulation that came together in Miletus has led to the criticism of the understanding of the universe based on aristocratic values and myths over time. The handling of this historical background in a context that allows new interpretations is related to the political ground. Thus, cosmos is theorized through the accumulation obtained from production processes. The important reason for this accumulation is the commodity trade carried out by Miletos. In our research within this framework, we will first establish the political city-police connection. By listing the characteristics of the police, we will discuss the political rights that emerge here. Then we will talk about the history of Ionia to mark the conditions under which these rights exist in Ionia. From here on, we will discuss Miletus and specify its politicaleconomic and cultural characteristics. In this way, we will argue that the emergence of philosophy should be treated as the movement of material and cultural accumulation to a new stage rather than the awakening of a community or the product of a mere genius.","2021","2022-12-15 12:09:17","2022-12-15 17:33:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Istanbul University Press","Istanbul","tr","","","","","Zotero","","Citation Key: guven_PolitikBirKent_2021","","","","10 politische Geschichte; 10-02 Geschichte: archaische Zeit; 10-03 Geschichte: klassische Zeit","","Güven, Özgüç; Kardeş, Murat Ertan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These decrees granting privileges including politeia (‘citizenship’) have been traditionally dated in the last third of the 4th century BC, although they more probably belong to the 3rd century. Instead of taking them as showing a form of continuous relationship between the mother city and her colonies since their origins, I suggest that they are a manifestation of Gehrke’s ‘intentional history’, i.e. a way to use and manipulate the past in order to serve the present. Therefore the revival of the links between colonies and mother city takes place in a context where we see Miletus seeking to establish or regenerate her regional power and international relations.","2022","2023-01-12 18:05:35","2023-01-26 12:06:28","","333-360","","","","","","","Colloquia antica","27","","","Peeters","Leuven","eng","","","","","","","Citation Key: muller_MigrationMemoireMilet_2022","","","","Kolonien; 10 politische Geschichte; 10-04 Geschichte: hellenistische Zeit","","Tsetskhladze, Gocha T.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, we collaborate closely with researchers from the humanities to create interactive and immersive applications for the novel field of WA research.

"WG47HIES","report","2004","Siegesmund, Siegfried; Rüdrich, Jörg","Das Markttor von Milet: Schadensanalyse und Modellhafte Sanierungskonzepte","","","","","https://doi.org/10.5165/hawk-hhg/130","Das Markttor ist (ein einzigartiges archäologisches Baudenkmal nördlich der Alpen) in seiner Dimension und Bedeutung als Objekt im inneren eines Museums in Deutschland einzigartig. Um so besorgniserregender ist der aktuelle, bauliche Zustand. Der Erhalt dieses bedeutenden Bauwerks erfordert mindestens kurz- bis mittelfristig restauratorische Maßnahmen, um einen fortschreitenden Verlust von Originalsubstanz aufhalten zu können. Vorrangiges Projektziel ist die modellhafte Schadensanalyse des umweltgeschädigten Markttores von Milet. Dieses einzigartige Objekt verlangt nicht zuletzt auch durch die „einzigartige“ Konzeption beim Aufbau um 1929 und die kriegsbedingten Wirren nach sehr spezifischen Untersuchungsstrategien. Grundlage ist zunächst die 3D-Vermessung des Objektes mit dem Ziel alle Schadensphänomene selektiv auch in Abhängigkeit von Objektbereichen, z.B. Originalteilen, die Expositionen, Bauphysik und lithologisch-strukturellen Vorzeichnungen aufzunehmen. Unbedingte Voraussetzung hierfür ist eine detaillierte Materialcharakterisierung von langzeitexponierten Orgienalteilen, die aufgrund der o.g. eigenwilligen Strategie beim Aufbau des Tores in ungewöhnlich großer Quantität existieren. Darüber hinaus sollen Modellversuche zur Materialverträglichkeit unter Laborbedingungen wie Marmor/Stahlarmierungen/Beton/Altergänzungen für ein optimales Sanierungskonzept sorgen. Die entsprechenden Umweltbedingungen sollen im Vorfeld durch Langzeitmonitoring erfasst werden. Alle dazu erforderlichen Untersuchungen werden interdisziplinär von Geowissenschaftlern, Vermessungsingenieuren, Archäologen, Restauratoren und Kunsthistorikern realisiert. Das Projekt ist der Zielsetzung entsprechend in zwei Phasen gegliedert: einem Vorprojekt (vorliegender Antrag), in dem die u.g. Messungen und Konservierungsversuche im Labor und vor Ort durchgeführt werden, und einem Hauptprojekt, in dem die Erkenntnisumsetzung und Konservierung von Säulen in die Architekturteile erfolgt. Ergebnisse und Diskussion Zusammenfassend muss festgestellt werden, dass das Markttor von Milet bei einer detaillierten Betrachtung sehr komplexe Schadensbilder aufweist. Neben der sehr eigenwilligen Aufbaustrategie in den 20er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts, die durch die statischen Bedenken zu massiven Eingriffen in alle Architekturteile geführt hatten, scheint der Luftminentreffer und die damit verbundene freie Bewitterung zu wesentlichen Schadensquantitäten geführt zu haben. Die Restaurierungsmaßnahmen nach dem 2. Weltkrieg haben zwar zu einer Sicherung des Bauwerkes geführt aber durch schlechtes Material und Restaurierungsfehler wesentlich zum schleichenden Verfall beigetragen. Die z.T. sehr auffälligen strukturellen Schäden gehen vermutlich auf Materialinkompatibilitäten und statischen Zwängungen zurück. Es ist auch anzunehmen, dass die innenliegende, nach erstem Anschein biegeweiche Stahlkonstruktion, durch Kriechen des Stahls sich verkürzt und verdreht hat. Dadurch werden die vertikalen Eigenlasten nicht mehr über das Skelett sondern u.U. außermittig von den dünneren Marmorschalen abgetragen was die beobachteten schalenartigen Abplatzungen erklären könnte. Dies belegen die allgegenwärtigen Risse und Abplatzungen. Sinterbildungen, Rostläufer und Salzausblühungen häufig mit makroskopischen Rissen assoziiert, unterstützen diese Befunde. Der mikrobiologische Befall scheint nicht kritisch. Der Marmor zeigt ebenfalls komplexe Schadensbilder, wobei hier kein deutlicher Unterschied zwischen den auskartierten Varietäten deutlich wird. Indirekte, zerstörungsfreie Untersuchungsverfahren, wie die Ultraschalltomographie, Georadar und die Widerstandsmessungen konnten zur Charakterisierung der entkernten Marmorsäulen erfolgreich eingesetzt werden. Das Raumklima scheint bei den bis momentan nachgewiesenen Temperatur- und Luftfeuchteschwankungen nicht indikativ für die nachgewiesenen Schadenstypen.  Weiterführende mineralogische und baustoffkundliche Arbeiten wurden zur Analyse aller verwendeten Baustoffe eingesetzt und auf der Basis der gewonnenen Daten erfolgte die Entwicklung eines Mörtels der den Stoffeigenschaften eines Marmors weitestgehend entspricht. Die entwickelten Mörtel aus der Kombination von Puzzolanen, Weißzement, definiert zusammengesetzten Zuschlägen (Quarzsand, Kalksteinmehl) und chemischen Additiven sind kompatibel mit den Marmoren des Markttores von Milet. Ferner sind die Mörtel ausreichend alkalisch, um den Stahl vor Korrosion schützen zu können. Die Verfärbung des Dolomitmarmors ist durch Trocknung reversibel. Weder der Calciumhydroxidgehalt noch die verwendeten Zusatzmittel beschleunigen nach bisherigen Erkenntnissen den Zerfall des Marmors und sind auch in Verbindung mit Stahl einsetzbar. Die Verträglichkeit der entwickelten Mörtel mit den im Bestand vorhanden Steinergänzungsstoffen gilt auf der Basis der durchgeführten Untersuchungen als gesichert. Die entwickelten Favoritenmörtel (Tabelle 2) optimal den geforderten physikalisch-mechanischen und den chemisch-mineralogischen Anforderungen angepasst worden und können am Markttor unbedenklich eingesetzt werden. Fazit Das Markttor von Milet zeigt sehr multiple Schadensszenarien, die neben umweltbedingten Schadensquantitäten wesentlich auf Materialunverträglichkeiten zurückzuführen sind und ihre Ursache in dem eigenwilligen Rekonstruktionsprinzip der 20er Jahre des letzten Jahrhunderts haben. Mineralogische und gesteinstechnische Materialuntersuchungen, zerstörungsfreie und zerstörungsarme Materialdiagnose, Raumklimamessungen, Schadenskartierungen als auch Mörtelneuentwicklungen (mit „Marmor-eigenschaften“) belegen einen dringenden Handlungsbedarf für restauratorische Maßnahmen.","2004","2023-01-27 10:35:40","2023-01-27 10:38:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georg-August-Universität Göttingen","Göttingen","de","","Abschlussbericht","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: siegesmund_MarkttorMiletSchadensanalyse_2004","","","","07 Architektur; 15 Ruinen und Geländepflege, Restaurierung; 07-05 Architektur: Platzanlagen und angrenzende Bauten","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One way around this limitation is through comparison of time-series, which should exhibit the same irregular patterning as the calibration curve. This approach can be employed most directly in the case of wood samples with many years growth present (but not able to be dated by dendrochronology), where the tree-ring series of unknown date can be compared against the similarly constructed               14               C calibration curve built from known-age wood. This process of curve-fitting has come to be called “wiggle-matching.”                          In this paper, we look at the requirements for getting good precision by this method: sequence length, sampling frequency, and measurement precision.

The date of the eruption has been a subject of much controversy because it must be linked into the established and intricate archaeological phasings of both the prehistoric Aegean and the wider east Mediterranean. Radiocarbon dating of material from the volcanic destruction layer itself can provide some evidence for the date of the eruption, but because of the shape of the calibration curve for the relevant period, the value of such dates relies on there being no biases in the data sets. However, by dating the material from phases earlier and later than the eruption, some of the problems of the calibration data set can be circumvented and the chronology for the region can be resolved with more certainty.                            In this paper, we draw together the evidence we have accumulated so far, including new data on the destruction layer itself and for the preceding cultural horizon at Thera, and from associated layers at Miletos in western Turkey. Using Bayesian models to synthesize the data and to identify outliers, we conclude from the most reliable               14               C evidence (and using the INTCAL98 calibration data set) that the eruption of Thera occurred between 1663 and 1599 BC.","2004","2023-03-23 12:55:32","2023-03-30 07:24:40","","325-344","","1","46","","Radiocarbon","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: bronkramsey_DatingVolcanicEruption_2004","","","","03 Funde aus Milet; 03-02 Funde: Varia; 04 Archäometrie; Bronzezeit; Radiokarbondatierung","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By using carbon-14 dates from the surrounding region, cultural phases, and Bayesian statistical analysis, we established a chronology for the initial Aegean Late Bronze Age cultural phases (Late Minoan IA, IB, and II). This chronology contrasts with conventional archaeological dates and cultural synthesis: stretching out the Late Minoan IA, IB, and II phases by ∼100 years and requiring reassessment of standard interpretations of associations between the Egyptian and Near Eastern historical dates and phases and those in the Aegean and Cyprus in the mid–second millennium B.C.","2006-04-28","2023-03-23 13:06:23","2023-03-23 13:06:35","","565-569","","5773","312","","Science","","","","","","","","en","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: manning_ChronologyAegeanLate_2006","","","","Bronzezeit; Radiokarbondatierung; 03 Funde aus Milet; 04 Archäometrie; 03-02 Funde: Varia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This period was also a crucial turning point for Didyma, an extra-urban sanctuary of Miletus. This occurrence of change is presumably an observable indication of one of the major structural shifts in the late classical and early Hellenistic periods. What impact did these political and cultural changes have on Milesian mythical narratives and historiographies? This study aims to examine Hellenistic myths and historiographies concerning the Didymaeum, the temple of Apollo Didymeus, focusing on theinfluence of contemporary Milesian religious and diplomatic activities and on interactions with Hellenistic rulers and other Greek city-states.","2023","2023-03-28 14:11:20","2023-03-28 16:33:54","","78-98","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","Literatursammlung Miletserver","","","","Citation Key: sato_HellenisticDidymaMilesian_2023","","","","Didyma; 08 Kulte und Kulteinrichtungen; 10 politische Geschichte; 10-03 Geschichte: klassische Zeit; 10-04 Geschichte: hellenistische Zeit; 08-01 Kulte: Varia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
