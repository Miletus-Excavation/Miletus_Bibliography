Hi there!

I logged some additional info while processing the database. If you see any problem here, please check the GitHub-Actions-Logs as well as all txt- and log-files in '/out/' for more information. Logged on 01.07.2024 while while running checks:


There are 4 items with suspect BibTeX-keys! Please check them and correct this. List of affected items saved to: out/wrong_keys.csv

**Critical**:
1 items do not have a pinned LaTeX-Citation Key! Please fix this in Zotero by adding it to the 'Extra'-field. The affected entries are: 
Styger, Paul 1933: Die römischen Katakomben: archäologische Forschungen über den Ursprung und die Bedeutung der altchristlichen Grabstätten


No duplicate LaTeX-keys. :) 


There are 90 items without precise tags (only groups)! Please check them and correct this. List of affected items saved to: out/items_without_precise_tags.csv

Thanks for checking!
